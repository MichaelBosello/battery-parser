# Procedure

1) delivery SOC

    discharge at 5A until V<sub>eod</sub> (line code: 12)

2) capacity test

    CC-CV charge at 1A until cutoff=4.2V, termination at 0,05A (line code: 17)

    discharge, 0,2A (line code: 19)

3) resistance cycle

    two steps alternated:

    first step, discharge at 0,5A for 10s (line code: 29)

    second step, discharge at 5A for 1s (line code: 30)

4) main cycle

    CC-CV charge at 1.8A until cutoff=4.2V, termination at 0,1A (line code: 37)

    discharge at 5A until V<sub>eod</sub> (line code: 40)

5) repeat the main cycle (point 4) 100 times, then perform a capacity test (point 2) and a resistance cycle (point 3), redo point 5

# Test name convention

000-XW-Y.Y-AABB-T

---

000 = sample serial number

X = lecter related to cell manufacturer

W = cell type | P: powertool, M: mid power, E: e-byke

Y.Y = cell capacity e.g. 2.5Ah -> 2.5

AABB = samples delivery date (AA: week, bb: year)

T = test type | S: Standard (5A discharge), H: High Current (8A discharge), P: Pre-conditioned (90 days storing at 45C degree before testing)
